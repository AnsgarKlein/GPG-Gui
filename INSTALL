You should compile GPG-Gui with a decently up-to-date Vala Compiler (valac),
which is available at git://git.gnome.org/vala

Many Distribution already offer a version of the Vala Compiler, while this
version probably is super out of date it should be sufficient.

If you use Ubuntu you can also add a Vala ppa:
ppa:vala-team/ppa

Since GPG-Gui depends on Gtk3 you also need that.


If you have all dependencies ready, install with:
	$make
