You should compile GPG-Gui with a decently up-to-date Vala Compiler (valac),
which is available at git://git.gnome.org/vala

Many Distribution already offer a version of the Vala Compiler, while this
version probably is super out of date it should be sufficient.

If you use Ubuntu you can also add a Vala ppa:
ppa:vala-team/ppa
(The package you need is called valac)

Since GPG-Gui depends on Gtk3 you also need that.
(On Ubuntu that package is called libgtk-3-dev)

For the actual encryption GPG-Gui currently uses xterm and
the command-line gpg utility. (You will need those two packages!)

# It's planned to use libgpgme for encryption in the future		#
# but it need to figure out how to port it to vala or someone else	#
# has to.																#

If you have all dependencies installed, install with:
	$make
